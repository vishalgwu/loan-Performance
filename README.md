# Loan Performance Data Insights
# Introduction--
The Fannie Mae Single-Family Loan Performance Data is a large dataset released by Fannie
Mae that includes detailed information on the performance of single-family mortgage loans. This
data is made available to help researchers, investors, and analysts better understand mortgage
loan performance and risk, as well as to improve modeling and analytics related to the U.S.
housing market.

# Key Features of the Dataset
## ‚óè Loan-level Data: It contains detailed data at the individual loan level, which allows for
in-depth analysis.

## ‚óè Credit Performance: The dataset tracks the performance of loans over time, including
delinquency status, credit scores, loan-to-value (LTV) ratios, and other factors that
influence loan performance.
## ‚óè Origination Data: Includes information on the characteristics of the loans when they
were originated, such as interest rates, loan purpose, and property types.
## ‚óè Performance Data: Tracks the performance of the loans on a monthly basis, including
payment history, default status, and modifications.
## ‚óè Modification Data: Includes details on any modifications to the original loan terms, such
as changes in interest rates or repayment terms.
Structure


# The dataset is split into two main parts:
1. Acquisition: This contains static information about the loans at the time they were
originated (e.g., credit scores, loan terms).
2. Performance: This tracks the monthly performance of each loan, such as delinquency
status, payments made, and loan modifications.
Data Coverage
The dataset spans from 2000 onwards, covering millions of loans.
It is updated quarterly, ensuring that the data remains relevant and reflects the latest
performance metrics.

## Data Access
Details of the dataset are present on the Fannie Mae website.
You will need to create a free Fannie Mae account in order to access the data.
We will be focussing on the Single-Family Loan Performance Data which can be downloaded
[üìÑ Fannie Mae Single-Family Loan Performance Data](https://capitalmarkets.fanniemae.com/credit-risk-transfer/single-family-credit-risk-transfer/fannie-mae-single-family-loan-performance-data)

The dataset spans quarters from 2006 to 2007.

## Tooling
You are expected to use pyspark in Google Colabs for this project. My recommendation is to
upload your dataset to your  Google Drive and then convert it from CSV to Parquet format
and then use the Parquet file for analysis in pyspark. You can use any Python library, such as
matplotlib, etc. of your choosing to create the plots. In addition, all
documentation/comments should be in the form of Markdown within the notebook itself.

## Analysis
For each piece of analysis, provide an explanation of the process as well as an interpretation of
the results.

Applied Big Data Analytics - GWU
1. Compare the average FICO across the two years.
2. The monthly delinquency rates for 30, 60 and 90 days past due and how they vary by
loan term
3. Stacked bar chart showing the poor, fair good, very good, and excellent credit score with
a mortgage per state for first time buyers.
4. Analyze correlations between the FICO Score, LTV Ratio, and Interest Rate with the
loan status.
5. Distribution of FICO Scores, LTV Ratios, and Interest Rates across different loan
statuses (performing, delinquent, defaulted).
6. Compare default rates for loans originated in different quarters to assess if default risk
has changed over time.
7. The percentage of the loan amount recovered after default, through foreclosure or other
means.
8. Plot average, median, and variance of property price changes over the entire duration,
bucketed by month.
